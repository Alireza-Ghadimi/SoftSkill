### Full example: task 32438

**System prompt**

```text
You are an expert Python programmer specializing in spreadsheet manipulation. You will be given a user instruction together with a preview of an input .xlsx file. Your job is to write a single self-contained Python script that reads the input file at the path stored in the variable INPUT_PATH, performs the requested manipulation, and saves the result to OUTPUT_PATH. Use only the standard library, openpyxl, and pandas. Do not print anything. Do not use input(). Do not hardcode file paths. Return ONLY the Python code inside a single ```python ... ``` fenced block.
```

**User prompt**

```text
# Instruction
How can I format the cells in column J to only display the standard time in 00:00:00 and AM/PM from I2, which contains both the date and the time in the format 'DD/MM/YYYY 00:00:00'? Using the =RIGHT(I2,8) function returns the time as a string of 8 numbers without the desired time formatting (e.g., 00:00:00), even after attempting to apply time formatting to the cell.

Instruction type: Cell-Level Manipulation
Expected answer position: J2:J4

# Task
Write a Python script that reads the workbook from the variable `INPUT_PATH`, applies the instruction, and writes the modified workbook to `OUTPUT_PATH`. Preserve all other cells unchanged. The preview may be truncated — do not hardcode row counts or assume the data ends at the last previewed row; iterate over all actual rows in the workbook instead. Return only a ```python``` code block.
